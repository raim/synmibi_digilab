The CASY System calculates all values expressed in milliliters as a concentration
of counts or volume in the undiluted, original sample. Therefore, the number of
measuring cycles, the nominal measuring volume (200 or 400 μl), the dilution factor,
and the calibration factor of the volume calibration (see Calibration Certificate
document included) are taken into account.

Multiplier =
Dilution_Factor * 1000 / (Measuring_Cycles * Measuring Volume (μl) * VolCalib_Factor)
